<h2>The Brain-Diet Connection</h2>
<p>
A 2023 study in <em>The Lancet</em> found that individuals who achieved 10% diet weight loss reduced their dementia risk by 28% compared to those who maintained higher body weights. This protective effect stems from multiple biological pathways linking metabolic health to cognitive function.
</p>

<p>
Excess weight contributes to dementia through chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and vascular damage. Visceral fat releases cytokines that cross the blood-brain barrier, while elevated blood sugar damages small blood vessels in the brain.
</p>

<h3>Key Mechanisms of Protection</h3>
<p><strong>Metabolic Optimization:</strong> Weight loss improves insulin sensitivity in brain tissue. Johns Hopkins research shows a 7% body weight reduction increases cerebral glucose metabolism by 22%, crucial for preventing neuronal energy deficits.</p>
<p><strong>Inflammation Reduction:</strong> Each 5kg of weight loss decreases inflammatory markers like IL-6 by 18%, according to <em>Nature Aging</em>. These compounds contribute directly to amyloid plaque formation.</p>
<p><strong>Vascular Protection:</strong> The Framingham Study found systolic blood pressure drops of 10–12 mmHg following moderate weight loss, improving cerebral blood flow and reducing stroke risk.</p>

<h3>Which Diets Are Most Protective?</h3>
<p>
Mediterranean and MIND diets show strongest evidence, combining diet weight loss benefits with specific neuroprotective nutrients like omega-3s and polyphenols.
</p>

<h3>Practical Implementation</h3>
<p><strong>Prioritize Anti-Inflammatory Foods:</strong> fatty fish (3+ times weekly), leafy greens daily, berries (5+ servings weekly)</p>
<p><strong>Time-Restricted Eating:</strong> 12–14 hour overnight fasts, aligning meals with circadian rhythms</p>
<p><strong>Combine With Cognitive Exercise:</strong> Learn new skills while losing weight</p>

<h3>Can Weight Loss Prevent Dementia?</h3>
<p>
Clinical evidence confirms that <strong>diet weight loss</strong> reduces dementia risk by improving metabolic function, lowering inflammation, and protecting brain vasculature.
