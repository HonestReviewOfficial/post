    <h1>5-Minute Keto Breakfasts - No Cooking Required!</h1>

    <p><strong>Stop choosing between skipping breakfast or breaking ketosis!</strong> These 5 lightning-fast keto breakfasts require zero cooking and keep you in fat-burning mode:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Power Coffee:</strong> Blend coffee + MCT oil + butter for instant mental clarity (0g carbs)</li>
        <li><strong>Yogurt Parfait:</strong> Greek yogurt + berries + chia seeds (5g net carbs)</li>
        <li><strong>Avocado "Toast":</strong> Halloumi cheese + avocado + smoked salmon (3g carbs)</li>
        <li><strong>Overnight Chia Pudding:</strong> Chia + almond milk + collagen (15g protein)</li>
        <li><strong>Nut Butter "Cereal":</strong> Almond butter + coconut flakes + hemp hearts</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> High-fat breakfasts reduce hunger hormones by 25% compared to carb meals (Journal of Nutrition). Prep takes just 10 minutes weekly - hard-boil eggs, portion chia jars, and slice avocados (store with lemon).</p>

    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Avoid "keto" yogurts with hidden sugars and nut butters with additives. For weight loss, choose higher-fiber options like chia pudding. For energy, add MCT oil to coffee.</p>
